Since 2010, solar energy adoption in Country X has grown exponentially, driven by government subsidies and declining panel costs. By 2015, solar accounted for 5% of the energy mix, jumping to 20% by 2020 after the introduction of tax incentives. Critics argue that this rapid growth has strained the grid infrastructure, though proponents highlight reduced carbon emissions by 30%. If storage technology improves, experts predict solar could dominate by 2030. Wind energy, a subset of renewables, has seen slower growth due to higher initial costs.
